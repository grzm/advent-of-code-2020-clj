* Advent of Code (2020)

Advent of Code in Clojur(Script) and Babashka.

** 2020 Goals
 * Write Clojure(Script) code that also works with Babashka
 * Use transducers where appropriate

   These are the same goals I had in 2017. I don't have much call to
   use CLJS in my daily work, and I haven't been using transducers
   much, so it's reasonable to set the same goals.

   Well, we do have Babashka now, too! 😍

** Usage

*** Clojure
#+begin_src shell
clojure -X com.grzm.advent-of-code.advent-2020.day-00/part-1
# => part-1
#+end_src

**** Clojure Tests
#+begin_src
clojure -M:test
make test
clojure -M:test --watch
make test-watch
#+end_src

*** ClojureScript
#+begin_src shell
shadow-cljs compile day-00-part-1
node target/day-00-part-1
# => part-1
#+end_src

The default ~make~ target will build all non-test shadow-cljs builds
#+begin_src shell
make
#+end_src

*** Babashka
#+begin_src shell
bb --classpath "$(clojure -Spath)" --main com.grzm.advent-of-code.advent-2020.day-00 -- part-1
# => part-1
# wrapper script
bin/run-bb day-00 part-1
# => part-1
#+end_src
